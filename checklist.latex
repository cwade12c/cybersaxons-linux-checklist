			\item{\color{red}\textbf{\emph{**DO THE FORENSICS QUESTION**}}}

			\item{\color{red}If you have done the forensics question, then read the competition scenario} before doing anything else. {\color{red}If there is a question, answer the question} before proceeding to the next steps.

			\item{\color{red}If} you have done the forensics question {\color{red}and} if you have read the competition scenario,
				{\color{red}then glance over} the tools on the Tool List.

			\item Consider setting up a strategy with the General Checklist. The checklist is sorted into
				color coordinated categories: \BlueVeryImportant{Blue are the "very important" issues that should
				immediately be addressed}; \YellowHardening{Yellow deals with hardening, requiring careful focus and no
				typos}; \GreenServices{Green deals with services and specific vulnerability patches}; \RedSearchAndDestroy{Red deals with
				search and destroy}; and \GrayElaborateHardening{Gray focuses on more elaborate methods of system hardening 
				that should only be addressed last}. One strategy might be to initiate some \RedSearchAndDestroy{Red scans} in
				tty1 while you work on the \BlueVeryImportant{Blue issues} in tty2. Another strategy is to simply follow the
				checklist in order.

			\item RTM (read the manual). Syntax: \textbf{man} \textit{command\_name} \\
				For example: \textbf{man ls}

				Also refer to search engines to answer questions, investigate tutorials, and learn how
				to further secure the system. Consider researching "Ubuntu / Debian security guides"
				and tutorials, searching for topics that you may not have already addressed.
